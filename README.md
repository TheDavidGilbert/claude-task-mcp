# claude-task-mcp

A local task management MCP server for Claude Code. Think of it as a local Jira — no sign-up, no platform, just a SQLite file in your repo.

Tasks are scoped to the current project directory and stored in `.claude-tasks/tasks.db` (gitignored). Claude Code connects to the server via stdio and can create, update, and query tasks as you work.

## Features

- Human-readable task IDs derived from your repo name (`CTM-0001`, `LOT-0042`)
- Workflow stages: `ideation → design → refinement → estimated → planned → in-progress → complete → deployed`
- Task types aligned with conventional commits: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`
- Priority levels: `low`, `medium`, `high`
- Assignee and due date fields
- Comments, task links (blocks / depends-on / relates-to)
- Full audit history — every change is recorded with who made it and when
- Web UI dashboard with board view and calendar view
- Zero config — auto-initialises on first use

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/claude-task-mcp
cd claude-task-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Claude Code configuration

Use the `claude mcp add` CLI to register the server. MCP servers are stored in `~/.claude.json` — do **not** add `mcpServers` to `~/.claude/settings.json`, it is not a valid field there.

**Global** (one server, works across all repos — pass `project_path` on each call):
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user tasks node "/absolute/path/to/claude-task-mcp/dist/index.js"
```

**Per-repo** (no need to pass `project_path` on each call — run from inside the repo):
```bash
claude mcp add --scope local tasks node "/absolute/path/to/claude-task-mcp/dist/index.js" \
  -e CLAUDE_TASKS_CWD="/absolute/path/to/your/repo"
```

> **Note:** The default scope for `claude mcp add` is `local` (project-level). Always specify `--scope user` for global registration, otherwise it will only apply to the current project.

After adding, restart Claude Code and run `/mcp` to confirm the `tasks` server is connected.

## Web UI

The server automatically starts a local web dashboard alongside the MCP server:

```
http://localhost:7654
```

The port defaults to `7654` and can be overridden with the `CLAUDE_TASKS_PORT` environment variable.

### Board view

The default view at `/` shows all tasks in a filterable list. You can filter by stage, type, and priority using the controls at the top. Click a task ID to open the detail page, which shows the description, comments, linked tasks, and full audit history.

### Calendar view

The calendar view at `/calendar` plots tasks by due date in a monthly grid. Navigate between months with the Prev/Next controls. Tasks appear as colour-coded chips (by stage) on their due date, each linking to the task detail page.

```
http://localhost:7654/calendar?path=/your/repo&year=2025&month=12
```

## Tools

| Tool | Required | Optional |
|------|----------|----------|
| `create_task` | `title`, `type` | `description`, `priority`, `stage`, `estimate`, `assignee`, `due_date`, `actor`, `project_path` |
| `get_task` | `task_id` | `project_path` |
| `update_task` | `task_id` + ≥1 field | `title`, `description`, `type`, `priority`, `stage`, `estimate`, `assignee`, `due_date`, `actor`, `project_path` |
| `list_tasks` | — | `stage`, `type`, `priority`, `project_path` |
| `add_comment` | `task_id`, `body` | `actor`, `project_path` |
| `link_tasks` | `from_task_id`, `to_task_id`, `link_type` | `actor`, `project_path` |
| `get_project_info` | — | `project_path` |

### Task fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `assignee` | string | Free-text username or display name of the person responsible |
| `due_date` | string | ISO 8601 date, e.g. `2025-12-31` — used to plot tasks in the calendar view |
| `actor` | string | Username to attribute the action to in the audit history |

## Task history

Every mutation is recorded in an audit log attached to the task:

| Event | Recorded when |
|-------|--------------|
| `created` | Task is first created |
| `stage_changed` | The `stage` field is updated — shows old and new stage |
| `field_changed` | Any other field is updated — shows field name, old value, new value |
| `comment_added` | A comment is appended |
| `link_added` | A link is created between two tasks |

Pass the optional `actor` argument to any mutating tool to attribute the change to a specific user. History is visible on the task detail page in the web UI.

## Workflow stages

```
ideation → design → refinement → estimated → planned → in-progress → complete → deployed
```

## Project prefix generation

The prefix is derived from your repo's directory name on first use:

| Directory name | Prefix |
|----------------|--------|
| `claude-task-mcp` | `CTM` |
| `language-server` | `LS` |
| `my-awesome-project` | `MAP` |

## Development

```bash
npm run dev    # run with tsx (no build step)
npm run build  # compile to dist/
npm run clean  # remove dist/
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` to drive all tools interactively.

## .gitignore

Add `.claude-tasks/` to your project's `.gitignore` to keep the task database local:

```
.claude-tasks/
```
